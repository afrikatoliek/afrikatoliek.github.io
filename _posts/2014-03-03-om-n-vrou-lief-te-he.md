Hierdie inskrywing dien as 'n herhinnering oor my gedagtes oor 'n moontlike roeping om te trou. Ek oorweeg ook die godgewyde lewe (monnik).

> [EDIT: Since writing this post, I have been challenged to discern my vocation. I might review it at a later stage, but if I would marry, the principles remain the same. And I also want to rewrite it in my home language, Afrikaans.]
 
I am looking to marry a Catholic woman. When I mention this to people, their responses seem to suggest that I just said something extremely racist or elitist. Many share their disapproval of such a "limited" view, and some seem to think that I somehow consider Catholics "better" than other human beings. Some of their objections are valid and practical, and I do hold onto these in the back of my mind. Other objections come from a lack of compassion and the inability to understand the "Catholic Heart" from the outside, and these I discard. Granted, my view will be limited and imperfect (how can it be otherwise), but I believe it is justifiable and prudent.
 
These things are important to me:

1. A wife should not be denied her obligation to honor her parents, that is, she should honor the wishes that her parents have for her, as far as it is loving and right to do so.
1. A wife should not be compelled to deny her own conscience and identity, in order to establish "peace" and foster "joy" between herself and her husband. 
1. Both parents should agree to the union and the future that it suggests, and consider it a very good thing for their children.
1. A wife and husband should be best friends and "partners in crime" (so to speak), both active in working towards the common good, and each receiving joy from having their partners present alongside them when doing the things they love.
1. A wife should consider her responsibilities towards God of greater value than her allegiance to her husband, and allow her husband the same benefit.
1. A wife should have the courage to be a mother, should not consider kids a burden, and be accepting of her sexuality and identity as a woman, intentionally created by God to be different from men but with equal dignity, and good in the sight of God.
1. Unity of faith is an important testimony to what God says of Himself and is a strong and healthy foundation for a family.
 
God continually invites all believers and seekers of truth, into one Catholic family, to worship and serve Him in unity, according to one understanding, not divided, but joined, according to the nature of God Himself. 
 
Mixed marriages may have a strong evangelical and ecumenical component, but I'd rather want to exert effort in living a holy life and raising gospel-driven kids, according to the teachings of one Christ-filled faith, than trying to navigate between the rocky waters of conflicting understandings of Christian life and thereby causing confusion and promoting the false belief of moral relativism. For a faith-based family, Christ is the rock to build their house upon, and this rock is not split in half.
 
Faithful Catholic life consists of a variety of devotions and practices strongly held and cherished. It would be difficult for a non-Catholic wife to accept those devotions and to actively participate in them, even though she is still Christian. I want my wife to participate with me in the worship of God, but I also want her to obey her conscience. Finding a faithful Catholic wife, will make this a non-issue.
 
One issue I foresee in marrying a non-Catholic woman, will be about the place of artificial contraception in married life. There is sufficient material written that indicates that artificial regulation of a woman's menstrual cycle is detrimental to her health. Also, in the Catholic Worldview, the use of artificial contraception for family planning, is not encouraged, for reasons worthy of your own time and research. Any woman reading this, knows that a man should *NEVER* mess with a woman's decisions regarding her body. This is a very sensitive subject and not to be taken lightly or forced upon a woman. Among Catholic woman, there is greater understanding and tolerance of the Church's teaching on the matter (although not a widespread acceptance). Often the joke goes that if you marry a Catholic woman, then you are going to have a big family. Those raised in the Catholic Worldview are taught to consider kids a gift from God, a contribution to the common good of humanity, and a selfless decision that benefits the love and holiness of the couple. I don't want to "change" my wife and I don't want to influence her decisions regarding such a sensitive matter. She should come to these conclusions by herself without coercion, and have acted according to her own conscience. Finding a wife from the Catholic pool of women, provides greater opportunity for new life, a life where even sexuality is clearly brought to obedience to Christ, and for finding a woman that freely accepts her own sexuality.
 
Lastly, because of the current divisions and distrust between Catholic and non-Catholic Christians, there are a few cultural challenges when marrying a non-Catholic Christian wife. I don't think a faithful Protestant father and mother would be very happy if their daughter were to marry a Catholic man (unless they somehow thought there was hope for converting him to their own faith tradition). And I wouldn't want to be the one to cause a rift between my wife and her parents. This opinion isn't fair, I know, because I have met some extremely loving parents that would accept any man as long as their daughter were truly happy and not in harms way. With enough mutual respect and common effort, this arrangement could work. Then there is also the notion of a Catholic wedding. Non-Catholic Christians would either be extremely confused, extremely bored, or extremely offended by it. It is a requirement for Catholic marriages that the kids be raised in the Catholic faith tradition. This is an obvious desire for Catholic parents and not even necessary to mention, but a non-Catholic wife might be more prone to find offense at this.
 
The Catholic/Orthodox Worldview is different from other Christian views, and it is unfortunate that many of our non-Catholic brothers and sisters first propose to preach their version of the gospel, before they try to understand our hearts. A well-formed "Catholic Conscience" will always have a difficult time to conform to other lifestyles.
 
Perhaps my current outlook on a marriage partner is what they would call a "strong opinion weakly held". I believe in God's providential way of bringing people together, and I acknowledge the power of attraction that often seems to override reason. Where my will is concerned, I'll direct my efforts according to my current understanding and resist the temptation of an attraction based on beauty without reason.
 
I'll probably edit this note as I learn to express myself better, and as my opinion matures.
