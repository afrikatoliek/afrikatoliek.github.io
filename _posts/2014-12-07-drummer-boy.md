A friend of mine organized a concert for his music students. A drummer was required for some of the songs, and this is where I come in. As the date of the concert drew closer, I realized that I needed a more effective approach for practising the songs. So with the help of my friend (and Google), I set off to notate the drums using Guitar Pro.

The job of the "drumkit operator" was to play basic drums for the following songs:

1. Forever in Blue Jeans
1. Eye of the Tiger
1. Guitar Man
1. Knocking on Heaven's Door
1. Layla
1. Listen to Your Heart
1. Little Lies
1. Smoke on the Water
1. Under the Boardwalk
1. Wild World

The fruits of this labour (gpx files for drumkit-only) can be found on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1tvrhlghu8t0t6u/AADbnhQn2sJs27s1ANv8qGdwa?dl=0) or Google Drive. The notation was arranged according to the requirements of the concert, so feel free to make modifications.
