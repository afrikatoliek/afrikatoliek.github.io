Perhaps you know me. I am a baby Catholic. I want to tell you a little about why I became Catholic and what that decision has meant for me since. I will tell you the family-friendly version (since life can be messy) and for the sake of time I will leave out many awesome stories, meetings and moments. I hope that you will remember some of this story one day, and that it will strengthen your own faith.

> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Mt5.6">Mt 5:6</a>

Let's start with a question. Is the Pope Catholic? Do you know the answer? Five years ago, I didn't. Like a sixth sense, the only thing I knew, was that it was a bad idea to be Catholic, and that I should avoid it at all costs. I had no personal experience to back that feeling up. I know now that if I actually searched for a reason, I would have found many opinions why not to be Catholic. But I was just not that concerned about it really. It didn't affect me, no one in my family was Catholic, I had no Catholic friends. 

<!-- Bible Verse. http://biblia.com/plugins/BibleVerse -->
> Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever. Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings; for it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited their adherents. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Heb13.7-9">Heb 13:7-9</a>

The Catholic Church was just not on my radar. It would be safe to say that for 25 years of my life, I did not know anything about the Catholic Church. And that there actually was a Church that calls itself Catholic, was news to me. Thankfully, I was a Christian, baptized as a baby in the Afrikaans N.G Church.

Then life happened. I became a wandering soul searching for forgiveness, truth and hope. First forgiveness, because I was carrying the burden of past sins. Then truth, because I wanted to know for certain who God is and how he wanted me to live. Lastly hope, because I wanted to know that everything would be okay.

> And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Mt16.18-19">Mt 16:18-19</a>

I arrived at the Bay Christian Family Church, a local Charismatic Pentecostal Christian Church, nearby in Strand. I was immediately captivated by the preaching, the music and the people. I was under the spell of that Church. There is so much more to say here, but for the sake of time, I will move on. This Church satisfied my desire for forgiveness and hope, but not my desire for truth. My conscience convinced me to leave that Church in search for truth, and so the desire for forgiveness and hope also was no longer satisfied.

> "But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he then said to the paralytic—"Rise, take up your bed and go home." And he rose and went home. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Mt9.6-7">Mt 9:6-7</a>

Suddenly the wilderness of Christian Churches and divisions became clear to me. I never knew that there were so many different views and opinions about Christianity. Can we even know truth, that question was on my mind, but still my faith gave me hope. During this time I did much reading and visited many Churches and spoke to many pastors. This was quite an adventure. Most of these Churches and pastors had many similarities, but there were also strong disagreement among them. I found none that satisfied my desire for truth. Along the way I discovered a strong desire for unity.

To make a very long, and interesting adventure short, I ended up in the Strand Baptist Church with a pastor that really demonstrated integrity, Christian virtues, and sound biblical preaching. My desire for truth was nurtured by him, and due to his gospel-centric preaching my longing for forgiveness and hope was also soothed. No Protestant pastor wants to hear that they were instrumental in someone's journey to the Catholic faith, so let me not single any one out: every Protestant pastor I ever met, was instrumental in my journey to Catholicism. But only one gave me a book on Church History. And that book put the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church on my radar for the very first time. What?! Christian communities that trace their heritage back to the time of the apostles! Unbelievable!

> And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Re12.11">Re 12:11</a>

Fast forward past many memorable meetings, and you find me at a crossroad, where God demanded a choice from me. He presented himself to me in the Catholic Church, and I could not immediately accept him. Catholics around the world, who lived their faith and shared the truth of Catholicism, answered the objections of critics with love. They let their light shine and witnessed to their faith, and I saw it everywhere: on blogs, on YouTube, in documentaries, in books, on radio, in the lives of the saints, and in the works of the popes. In the end I was convinced by reason, love, faith and unity. My conscience brought me to the Catholic Church. I could go nowhere else.

> And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age." &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Mt28.18-20">Mt 28:18-20</a>

After attending higher grade Catechism classes for a year, I was confirmed right here at St. Paul's by Fr. John. Fast forward nearly four years into the future, and you find me here, speaking to young Catholics about the beauty of their faith. In that time I have grown immensely in my understanding of my purpose in life and my role in God's kingdom. Now everything I do has a newfound meaning and purpose. Everything is connected to God in some way. This meaning is not based on psychology, or feelings, but based on faith and the truth of Christ administered by the Church.

> if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/1Ti3.15">1 Ti 3:15</a>

What convinced me that the Catholic Church is where God wants every person to be? A boatload of things working together. From the faith side of things it was a realization of the love the Father has for us, the prayers of the Son, the witness of the saints, and the evangelization of the nations through history. 

You will learn those truths at Catechism classes, but will you remember them? Don't miss a class and always be interested in your faith. Always ask questions. Seek truth. Be informed. Trust in God. Use your heart, mind, soul and strength to love God. That is why you have them.

> I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh." The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Jn6.51-54">Jn 6:51-54</a>

What should every Catholic know and come to appreciate? There is so much! The beginning and the end, is the Eucharist (communion). Everything in between is an adventure! Get to know the scriptural passages that speak about the Eucharist, the incarnation, the forgiveness of sins, the papacy, baptism, Mary, the Holy Spirit, the first Christian council. Learn about the history of the Church. Get to know the stories of the saints. Seek to understand the work of the Holy Spirit in the history of the Church in continuity with the present, especially through the Church councils. Get to know and appreciate the Eastern Orthodox Church. Read books written by the saints and the popes, in their own words. Explore our vast treasure of prayers and hymns. Try and understand what our Protestant brothers and sisters believe.

> Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained." &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "http://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Jn20.21-23">Jn 20:21-23</a>

We are Catholic, we are Christian and we have been commanded by Jesus to make disciples, to baptize them and to teach them his commands. I am Catholic, because of the efforts of many in the Church who obeyed that commandment of Jesus. And my wish for you, is that you will cry to God for the grace to see yourself, and every human being, and every part of creation, through his eyes, the eyes of God himself, in truth.

You are surrounded by the gift of truth, Christ Himself, in the Catholic Church. Explore him, get to know him, and share him with others. There are enough Catholics who through disobedience to the Spirit, bring scandal to Christ and to the Church. Please, let everyone here, decide today that they will be numbered among the Catholics who bring glory and honour to God with their lives. Dedicate yourself to God and to His Bride, the Church. Be a saint! He loves the Church and he loves his mother, and if we are little Christs, then so should we.
